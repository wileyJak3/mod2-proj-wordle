 ### All In One Dictionary
Problem: currently you have to search urban dictionary and another dictionary seprately to find out if the word you are looking up is slang, an actual word, or not a word at all. Even frequently used online acronyms must be search seprately such as GG, or FTW. This app intends to off one location to find out all the available information about a word in one search.



### Technical Problem Solution
The application will make use of the urban dictionary api and other free dictionary api to get the get the definitions of the words. The user will input a word/string that will be search in the databases of all the dictionary applications. The data will either be stored inside an object before display using map or directly called and  displayed on the screen as a component for each dictionary.
